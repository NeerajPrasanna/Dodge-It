This is a simple game, made using pygame module in Python.

The user has the options to either move the character up, or down using the up and down arrow keys.

Obstacles are generated randomly and the goal is to dodge as many obstacles as possible.

The player gains 18 points for every obstacle dodged.

This is my first venture into game dev with python so any feedback will be much appreciated!
